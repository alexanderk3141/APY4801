          <h4>2. Background Information</h4>
          <p>SARS-CoV-2 is a new coronavirus that was initially identified in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019 and caused
            a worldwide disease known as COVID-19. It was declared a pandemic by the WHO in March 2020 and numerous
            protective measures in an attempt to prevent the spread of the disease were implemented by governments
            across the world. These are the strictest measures of public health and infection control which include
            strict hygiene controls, self-isolation, quarantine, restriction of movement and social distancing
            (Mashaphu, 2021). The management of patients infected with the disease deviates from how normal social
            customs have always dictated. In South Africa, these regulation prohibit visitation in hospitals, families
            are unable to communicate with their sick relatives even with death is imminent, affecting numerous rituals
            and that have been established for centuries. Lockdown restrictions prohibited large gatherings of people
            resulting in a severe isolation from relatives and a lack of social interaction in what humans who are
            notoriously social beings. Many cultural practices were prohibited, such a funerals and initiation rites
            leading to a psychological impact in young adults (Mashaphu, 2021). Other social normal relating to
            spirituality and religion were also affected, particularly the indigenous knowledge systems that believe in
            order to be fully human, all aspects of well- being need to be addressed (physical, mental, social, economic
            and spiritual).</p>
          <br>
          <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly changed the way in which we view our world, how we deal with
            specific issues and how we deal with situations that have been forced on us by the government with very
            little consultation (Pillay, 2021). The simple term of social distancing says it all and should have never
            been implemented as such – physical distancing would perhaps have had a better psychological effect on what
            was enforced. Most normal social practices allow people to experience cohesiveness and belonging and by
            restricting these practices, a loss of routine pleasurable social activities will be experience (Mashaphu,
            2021). The social issues of society, culture and religious practice in South Africa are very sensitive
            issues in a changing world where inequality and vulnerability is the norm. Anthropology forces us to observe
            the world from various different viewpoints (Auerbach, 2020) and the virus in South Africa has once again
            revealed separations that were entrenched in our history and has highlighted the inequalities in the
            country. The long term effects of this social isolation are yet to be reported on. It is important to note
            that at times like these, when changes are enforced on entire populations, there may be unexpected
            possibilities to incorporate our indigenous knowledge systems more effectively into our world views
            (Mashaphu, 2021).</p>
          <br>
          <p>Traditional health practitioners (THP’s) have been struggling to gain recognition as equals to the
            biomedical systems in the country (legal and otherwise) ever since the post-colonial paradigm of alleged
            witchcraft forced the traditional healers to be marginalized (Moshabela, 2016). The THP’s have a far more
            holistic approach to healing than the biomedical models and together with the ethical principles of Ubuntu,
            may have a massive role to play in dealing with the pandemic (Mashaphu, 2021). Traditional healers have a
            holistic approach to dealing with illness and adversity, and, as South Africans are faced with numerous
            issues other than merely physical adversity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, they may have a contributory
            role to play in dealing with the social issues associated with COVID-19. Anthropologists could play in
            intermediate role in guiding and advising the healers from both biomedical and traditional healer worldviews
            as to the correct cultural way to deal with the issues faced currently in the country. Anthropologists are
            constantly looking for ways to decolonialise the subject and find new ways of understanding cultures from
            the communities own cultural viewpoint (UNISA, 2022) and perhaps the use of sangomas could provide exactly
            that sort of knowledge production (Colorado, 2018 and Thornton, 2013). We are so used to the Western
            biomedical approach to illness and tend to forget that 80% of South Africans still seek the advice of a
            traditional healer and value their input more (Moshabela, 2016). Traditional healers have a holistic
            approach in that they do not see the individual patient, but consider healing/curing by involving the family
            and the community to participate. This may be difficult in the case of COVID-19 where so many restrictions
            have been enforced (Moshabela, 2016). Medical anthropologists have vastly studied the effects of pandemics
            on social and economic life, including the effect on health care workers and health services (Manderson,
            2020). COVID-10 appears to be outside of a specific culture but its impact is felt socially through
            quarantine, lockdowns, border control and strict hygiene rules show how human lives are impacted on a social
            level. To date, no other pandemic has elicited these drastic measures (HIV, SARS, H1N1 flu, ebola and zika
            for example) (Manderson, 2020). The challenges imposed by this pandemic are going to need emotional,
            psychological and spiritual support and in order to provide this, we need to understand the roles that
            customs, beliefs, rituals and values of South Africans to ensure coping mechanisms (Mashaphu, 2021)</p>

          <h4>3. Problem Statement</h4>
          <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has left society with many stresses and possible long term effects of social
            isolation. The problem identified in this proposal questions what measures could be used or put in place to
            compensate for the loss of social norms and values enforced by the pandemic and whether the indigenous
            healers of the country could play a role in compensating through their holistic approach.</p>

          <h4>4. Theoretical Framework</h4>
          <p>The future of Anthropology relies on a change in direction, to decolonize the field and get rid of the old
            traditions of colonialism (UNISA, 2022). Anthropology research looks at experiences of people in a specific
            setting and within the context of the experience. It tries to use a holistic approach to understand the
            culture and does not search for a cause of an event or experience. One of the ways to understand and
            overcome is the concept of Ubuntu, which is readily supported by Anthropologists trying to move forward in
            South African anthropology. And who better to get involved than the traditional healers of the country who
            make it their business to approach healing holistically (UNISA, 2022). Ubuntu, or humanness, is a concept of
            caring, harmony and respect, or interdependence if you like. The values include reciprocity, putting
            yourself second and promoting a symbiotic relationship with all involved (Mashaphu, 2021). African
            anthropology follows the principles of Ubuntu, thereby ensuring that ethical anthropology is the order of
            the day (UNISA, 2022). It follows the idea that researchers should do right by the people they study, and
            following an ethical attitude of Ubuntu ensures that no-one is neglected or used as raw data for research
            publications. In order to study the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, all aspects of knowledge must be
            considered, not only the Western Biomedical model of healing. The COVID-19 pandemic may give some
            opportunities for Anthropologists to put their money where their mouth is and actually make a difference. In
            many African countries, anthropologists are treated with suspicion and is considered to be the last proof of
            colonialism still present, for this reason a change in approach is required (Mkhwanazi, 2020). There are
            numerous examples of how anthropologists have contributed to the care of marginalized communities with some
            very interesting outcomes. Panneerselvam et al (2020) published a study of the indigenous people of
            Tamilnadu who rely strongly on traditional knowledge systems and healing for their well-being. They distance
            themselves from public healthcare systems because of their lack of spiritual input, similar to some
            communities in South Africa. The authors describe how the anthropologists, who know the communities and
            their worldviews are able to make a difference in the management of COVID-19 in these sort of areas. Berrio
            et al (2021) did a study where they use Critical Medical Anthropology to explain how the politics of a
            community enforces inequalities and the well-being of the people is determined by the people and their
            institutions who have the power. Brazil and Mexico were two examples of countries that were hit very badly
            by the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors argue that critical medical anthropology is vital to keep social
            justice at the forefront of this and future pandemics. Anthropologists like Colorado (2018), Thornton (2013)
            and Langdon (2021) have strongly advocated the incorporation of indigenous knowledge systems into a new
            Anthropology where the communities themselves are involved in explaining and understanding the cultures and
            worldviews. Credo Mutwa (2003) wrote books on the subject and was willing to give up on the oath he swore to
            protect the knowledge of the sangomas of Africa in order to allow people to understand the actual cultures
            better and to ensure that the knowledge systems were not buried with those who knew the secrets of the
            communities that thrived before colonialism began and reduced the people of Africa to the “Other”, savages
            and uneducated people that required saving from the western educated people. This modernism, post
            colonialism, African anthropology and decoloniality of anthropology in Africa has been the focus for some
            time now and needed incorporation of traditional knowledge systems that form the basis of the focus
            currently. Harrison (2016) talks about how the knowledges of the people that make Anthropology possible are
            often more sophisticated than we think, but we need to humble ourselves and immerse ourselves in their
            everyday lives and become enculturated within their positionality and not our own.</p>

          <h4>5. Methodology</h4>
          <p>Anthropological research is qualitative by its very nature. It looks at experiences of people in a specific
            setting and within the context of the experience. The methodology used in this study will be collection of
            qualitative data as this would be the most suitable method of gathering information.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Mashaphu (2021) concludes her article with “At times like these, when change is forced upon and entire
            population, opportunities may arise for us to explore our indigenous knowledge systems for fluidity,
            flexibility and resilience”. This is the position I would like to take in this proposal.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I would gain permission to randomly question South Africans in Gauteng. The subjects would sign an ethical
            consent form allowing use of their responses in a publication.</p>
          <br>
          <p>As participant observation is problematic during this pandemic where social distancing is a norm,
            innovative methods of study need to be investigated, and particularly digital methods. Anthropologists are
            having a hard time trying to figure out new ways of “doing” anthropology, interviews, and group discussions
            and actually knowing the language of the people it is studying still remains a challenge. Digital
            interviewing may be a solution, but again, not all communities have access and there are ethical issues of
            informed consent that play a role. This is why it is important to use an Ubuntu approach, to include reason
            and emotions (UNISA, 2022)</p>
          <br>
          <p>The questionnaire is still under development but would include mainly yes/no questions such as:</p>
          <br>
          <ol class="questionaire">
            <li>Would you be open to consult with a traditional health practitioner (THP) to assist with the healing
              process of COVID-19?</li>
            <li>Do you have easy access to a THP?</li>
            <li>Would you visit a THP for treatment of COVID-19 related problems, physical and/or spiritual?</li>
            <li>What are you finding the most difficult to cope with from a social perspective based on the restrictions
              enforced on the general population?</li>
            <li>Would you consult both a biomedical system and a THP?</li>
            <li>Which would you believe could better help with the problems you are experiencing?</li>
            <li>Would you prefer that the doctors and the THP’s work together and consult together to heal you?</li>
            <li>Do you think a collaboration between the two is in any way possible as THP’s are regarded with suspicion
              by biomedical doctors?</li>
            <li>Do you believe in the “muti” that is supplied by the sangomas? Do you think it will be able to cure
              COVID-19?</li>
            <li>In what way would THP’s be able to assist you with your problems?</li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <p>These would be the starting questions, depending on the responses I receive initially, I may change and
            adapt the questions to ensure that my positionality is not affecting the responses.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I also plan to digitally interview as many sangomas as I am able to ask their opinion on the matter.
            Similar questions but more related to exact examples of what they can do to assist patients. I am of the
            belief that there is obviously little they can do physically to assist patients who need urgent life support
            in severe cases but my interest lies more in the effect this pandemic is having on the man in the street,
            not terminally ill patients. Their relatives would be more of assistance in deciding on the impact of
            sangoma spiritual support and their inclusion would also be considered. Asking impromptu interviews from
            people on the street might be a better approach if people were willing to participate. I am considering
            including Caucasians as well because many people are turning to a “new age” form of spirituality which
            includes sangomas and they may consult as well. Also this might contribute to the lack of “whiteness”
            studies in South Africa as most research is done on the previous so-called “others” and the move away from
            colonialism is not truly achieved.</p>

          <h4>6. Literature Review</h4>
          <p>There have been some publications regarding the Anthropology of public health, specifically relating to
            COVID-19, but very few relating to the South African situation. Hahn and Schoch-Spana (2021) refer to four
            anthropological principles that give insight into the current COVID-19 pandemic namely; Conceptualization
            and framing illness, social determinants of health, health determination of society and responses to public
            health issues. The give examples to explain how the concept of illness largely stems from historical social
            ideas and values. The feel that the manner in which societies organize themselves is a source of pathologies
            and illness within that society and health conditions can then alter the organization of these societies.
            They go on to say that public health responses are social processes that could affect the outcome of
            intervention measures imposed. The University College of London published a blog on eight ethnographic
            voices from South Africa with short passages on how MA students experienced the onset of the lockdown in
            South Africa, describing some very different experiences (Botes et al, 2020). There have also been some
            publications regarding how the pandemic has affected and mostly worsened the inequality situation in South
            Africa (Pillay, 2021).</p>
          <br>
          <span class="underline">Annotated Bibliography</span>
          <br>
          <p>General explanation of the suggested readings:</p>
          <br>
          <p>There is the suggestion by Landscape Archaeologists that Anthropology and Archaeology need to change to
            include indigenous science, traditional worldviews and specifically that of the inclusion of shamans and
            maybe sangomas (Colorado article). It is a known fact that the COVID-19 pandemic has tremendously impacted
            on people’s worldviews and social behaviour. There has also been a massive impact on the mental health of
            many people due to many rituals and norms not being able to be followed (Mashaphu article). The question of
            Anthropology, ethics and future methods of study because of the COVID-19 pandemic has been highlighted. The
            inequalities in many societies have been highlighted through the pandemic and the effects of the strict
            lockdown are going to be felt long after the pandemic has passed (Mkhwanazi article). Article 5 and 6 are
            examples of how Anthropologists (away from Africa) have tried to deal with these issues in their studies and
            publications. The issues and problems are startlingly close to those seen in Africa. Article 7 and 8 look
            closer at the depth of shamanism and the possible role it could play in dealing with human behaviours and
            other influences in life and Anthropology (e.g. the COVID-19 pandemic). Article 4 deals with the ongoing
            debate between traditional healers (i.e. shamans) and the biomedical paradigm. I was wondering if there was
            a possibility of traditional healers playing a role in the holistic treatment of the COVID-19 pandemic.
            Article 10 is once again about the role shamans and traditional healers could play in the future of
            Anthropology already describing a system of bungoma. I included the 2x books by Credo Mutwa because he was a
            sangoma and throughout his books refers to how the ancients could answer all the problems of the modern
            world and cure many problems. He strongly believes that Africans are not properly understood according to
            their worldviews and therefore are not living life to the fullest.</p>
          <br>
          <p>So then, my idea for the proposal. The idea was to interview patients to find out whether people felt
            traditional healers would be able to better manage the pandemic and use their holistic approach (which has
            been sadly lacking) to ensure people deal better with life and its rituals. I also want to know exact
            practical examples of how the patients believe this could happen. I also wanted to interview or perhaps
            digitally (a newer approach) interview the sangomas to find out their opinion on the matter. Would they be
            able to assist people to cope better, (holistically), in conjunction with Western medicine, which is
            something they has been striving to do for a long time now. This might be the perfect opportunity to combine
            the 2x worldviews to work towards a healthy physical and mental people of Africa. That would be the starting
            point, depending on what came out of the study, this might prompt more direct questions and interaction.</p>

          <br>
          <p><span class="bold-text">About the books: </span>Indaba, my children tells the story of the history of the
            Zulu people, starting with the creation story, the tree of life, the history of Zimbabwe, the coming of the
            Phoenicians or the strange ones as Mutwa calls them, the tales of Lumukanda and into book 4 where he talks
            about the African man as he is today and gives some reasons as to why certain beliefs still exist among the
            black people of southern Africa. Mutwa’s stories are told in as very entertaining and gripping account of
            the culture in southern Africa. In between the different chapters, he includes very interesting information
            on his opinion on things that are taken for granted in South Africa. On numerous occasions he states that he
            is a traitor to his people for telling these stories as he swore and oath of secrecy when he became a
            sangoma; unfortunately he has no one to take over his knowledge and is saddened by the fact that his
            knowledge will be lost for future generations. This is partly why he wrote these books to make sure the
            knowledge and traditions were retained. He also refutes many archaeological facts that have been taken for
            granted as being the truth and offers alternative explanations which makes this book a fascinating read.
            Zulu Shaman: Dreams, Prophesies and Mysteries is a sort of an autobiography which tells the story of how
            Mutwa first ignored the calling from his ancestors to become a sangoma resulting in him becoming very ill
            and through his youth when he accepted the calling and was trained as a sangoma. This book also covers some
            of the history of the Zulu people as Mutwa tells it and also goes on to his encounters with aliens and deals
            a little with the UFO conspiracy theories which he believes to be the truth. This book also contains many of
            his prophesies such as the bombing of the twin towers and also some to still come. Again, he shares fiercely
            guarded secrets of Zulu healing and spiritual practices for the reason that his knowledge will be lost if he
            does not. He has many opinions regarding beliefs that have guided fields such as archaeology, history and
            anthropology telling quite different accounts of what they truly mean. Both books are fascinating reading
            and his genius regarding curing powers of the sangoma and the psychic power of the Zulu people cannot be

          <p><span class="bold-text">About the author: </span>Credo Mutwa (1921 – 2020) was a very controversial
            character in South Africa. He has been called many names and is considered a national treasure by some. He
            was a Zulu sangoma, an author, an artist/sculptor and an expert on UFO conspiracy theories. He was a
            self-proclaimed expert of African culture and religions. His peers considered him to be a prophet, a
            diviner, a scientist, a storyteller, psychologist, clairvoyant, artist and sculptor. He was rejected by many
            academics as being a fake when it comes to Zulu beliefs and traditions. Mutwa defended himself over the
            years and published numerous books on the subject of African tradition and the ways of traditional healers.
            Despite having sworn an oath to not disclose the ways of the traditional healer, Mutwa felt that the
            knowledge was not being passed on by oral tradition and he chose to disclose some of the valuable knowledge
            he had gained over the years.</p>

          <p><span class="bold-text">About the article: </span>This article addresses the mental challenges that people
            in South Africa have experienced during the COVID-19 epidemic. The challenges cannot be endured for too long
            and eventually emotional and spiritual support will be needed to get through this difficult time. The strict
            measures imposed on the people of South Africa such as hygiene measures, social distancing and isolation
            gave little thought to the mental, social, physical and economic readiness of the people. The paper focusses
            on the importance of culture, spirituality and religion during this time to help with resilience and
            support. Numerous rituals that are the norm for specific cultures are not able to be followed, such as
            funerals and rites of passage have left people feeling psychologically affected. The authors strongly
            recommend a spirit of “Ubuntu” to reinforce togetherness, support, and reciprocity within the community in
            order to enhance social connections and allow for the vital rituals to take place, perhaps even digitally as
            a form of closure. Other concepts of Ubuntu that are suggested include detailed ideas to promote unity,
            self-determination, collective work and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity and
            faith. The authors have borrowed the ideas from the West African culture of Nguzo-Saba and are of the
            opinion that crises such as the COVID pandemic should stimulate scholars to use the opportunity to explore
            our indigenous knowledge systems and implement behaviors to deal with the challenges faced.</p>

          <p><span class="bold-text">About the article: </span>This publication was based on a blog discussion opened by
            the Wenner-Gren Foundation who asked various anthropologists how that saw the COVID pandemic affecting the
            field of study with specific reference to methods, ethics and whether research should be continued at all
            during this time. The author is of the opinion that the COVID-19 pandemic has clearly exposed inequalities
            known to be present in South Africa and that anthropology in South Africa has a history of activism and does
            not have a problem with speaking out about injustices. She states that the students are now faced with a
            problem as to how they should document the pandemic at the same time realizing the inequalities that COVID
            has shown. The strict lockdown is South Africa has disproportionately affected the poor and marginalized,
            increasing vulnerable populations. Students are facing an overwhelming task of adapting to possible digital
            fieldwork, feeling that this would emphasize the inequalities already present between researcher and the
            people they study/interview. The author states that Anthropology in this country is still an independent
            field, unlike the rest of the world, and should use the time wisely to elevate the poor reputation of
            Anthropology, which is still one of colonialism. No real solution to the issues at hand are given by the

          <br>
          <p><span class="bold-text">About the article: </span>This article describes the ongoing debate between
            traditional health practitioners (THPs) and the worldview of the biomedical paradigm, a debate that has been
            addressed numerous times in the countries’ history. The two are viewed differently as biomedical paradigm
            uses scientific knowledge and the THPs use and indigenous knowledge approach. A lot of progress has been
            made in the country to recognize the THP and they are now protected under the Traditional Health
            Practitioners Act (22 of 2007). This South African Health Review of 2016 reports on a review conducted and
            the authors describe four main themes regarding the situation in South Africa. There is strong evidence of
            medical pluralism in South Africa, conflicting paradigms of knowledge exist, traditional healing has a close
            association with religious knowledge systems of the country and a possible collaboration between traditional
            healing and biomedical systems is tainted by mistrust, tensions and unresolved issues. Biomedicine follows a
            culture-free approach to disease and is founded on the science of biology where THP can be called by their
            ancestors, knowledge is passed on without any documentation and their remedies are determined by spiritual
            forces rather than pharmaceutical qualities. The two fields also have opposing worldviews when it comes to
            approaches to healing/curing. Biomedicine has a biological curative approach where THP heals use a
            spiritual, holistic approach where illness is more of a psychosocial conditions needing spiritual and mental
            healing as well. There are a number of other issues involved and the author is of the opinion that both
            systems do not function in the same sphere, nor do they have the same goals so should therefore not be
            compared and be forced to co-exist.</p>

          <p><span class="bold-text">About the article: </span>This article tells of the Tamil people of India being
            unique indigenous people and how the COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted on their lives. Their
            communities prefer to use traditional knowledge systems particularly when health issues are involved.
            Because of this they need to be made more aware of the problems faced with COVID-19, they have many
            comorbidities and are therefore a vulnerable population. The authors describe a process called Grounded
            Theory which allows the researcher to collect data and analyze at the same time. The vulnerability of these
            communities needs to be addressed from the perspective of their own worldview and healthcare beliefs. There
            are two views, one of folk medicine and then the great traditional medicine such as Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha,
            yoga, homeopathy, to name but a few. The author feels that Anthropologists should play a careful role
            assisting the government – there should be ongoing communication between healthcare professionals and the
            tribal leaders. These communities need psychosocial support and appropriate mental health care due to their
            vulnerability. I was surprised to see how little their situation differs from that of the vulnerable
            communities in South Africa.</p>

          <p><span class="bold-text">About the article: </span>This article focusses on the COVID-10 situation in Brazil
            and Mexico. The authors are concerned with issues of coloniality and marginalization as existent
            inequalities have been worsened by the pandemic. They are of the option that the theory and practice of
            Critical Medical Anthropology (CMA) with a focus on political economy of health is required to ensure social
            justice during this pandemic. The authors feel that the poor roll-out of vaccinations in Brazil was due to
            the government’s slow response, this is exactly where CMA has its focus, people and institutions who hold
            the power affect the health and social inequality of their communities. They feel that the most destructive
            effects are seen among black and indigenous communities. Similarly in Mexico, structurally vulnerable
            populations are the most affected by the pandemic and they have resorted to self-care to treat COVID-19 as
            well as other chronic conditions. The authors feel that inequality is the driving force of this pandemic and
            it requires global coordination and community participation to overcome the problems. They also go on to
            state that populism has nurtured COVID-19 conspiracy theories and which is reflected in the high mortality
            rates in Brazil, Mexico and the USA. A political economy approach would address all the impacts of the
            pandemic as politics is a primary structural cause of COVID-19 mortality. This should be recognized so that
            political accountability could be brought to the discussion table. Anthropology must remain a critical
            involved component of this project and should not be critically looking in. Once again, I was surprised to
            see the similarities with the South African situation.</p>

          <p><span class="bold-text">About the article: </span>This article looks at the pioneering work done by Esther
            Jean Langdon in studying shamanism and the anthropological effects of shamanism. Very little on the subject
            was published by anthropologists before the 1980’s as they tried to fit it in with Western categories.
            Authors such as Langdon queried the inclusion of shamanism in Anthropology particularly in debates about
            magic, religion and science. The authors at the time were of the opinion that shamanism was a vital part of
            the social life of the indigenous people of South America. She also proposed the “shamanism in movement”
            idea as until now it was assumed to be static, highlighting the transformations and reinventions involved
            with shamanism. In the 1990’s Langdon wrote a book titled “Shamanism in Brazil: New Perspectives” which went
            on to highlight the importance of shamanism as an anthropological topic and to suggest the production of
            theoretical models to understand the system of shamanism. Langdon highlighted the connection between
            shamanism and her desire to explain the human experience of rituals, symbols and narratives). Research on
            contemporary shamanism shows that their rituals are directed towards individual, psychological and
            therapeutic issues. Langdon has also argued that anthropological studies of shamanism actually reveal a
            history of anthropology itself. Langdon’s pioneering work on the shamanism of the contemporary world has
            gone a long way in the anthropological understanding of different world views.</p>

          <br>
          <p><span class="bold-text">About the article: </span>This article also stresses the importance of indigenous
            ways of knowing, referred to as indigenous science by Colorado. It focusses on indigenous science as the
            place-based, holistic and spiritual knowledge system of the indigenous people. Colorado promotes the use of
            landscape archaeology together with indigenous science to advocate the use of a shamanic-scientific research
            protocol. She believes that this is the way forward, for indigenous science to stand together with Western
            science in a dynamic and sharing partnership. Landscape archaeology is a multidisciplinary approach to
            develop methods to investigate the effects of physical and tangible aspects of the landscape. She gives
            examples of archaeologists using shamanic consciousness techniques to investigate sacred sites, e.g. the
            petroglyphs of Alaska and the Kurgans of Karakol Valley. Excavating these sites does not allow us to find
            out about previous lives, but a possible collaboration between anthropologists and indigenous people might
            facilitate a good relationship. Colorado also cautions against anthropologists not following ethical
            considerations by the example of Maria Sabine who was exploited because of her healing techniques. She
            recommends the use of an indigenous sacred site guardian to protect against this in future research. She
            goes on to state that from an indigenous science perspective, it is of more value to preserve sacred sites
            than any of the information that might be gained from excavations of the sites. She is adamant that these
            sacred sites recharge communities and create new relationships with the ecology and landscape.</p>

          <p><span class="bold-text">About the article: </span>This was a documented conversation between Faye Harrison
            and three other American Anthropologists, focusing mostly on decolonizing anthropology. Harrison published a
            book titled “Decolonizing Anthropology” in 1991 which was considered to be ahead of its time. When asked how
            this publication came about, Harrison explained her association with the Association of Black
            Anthropologists (ABA) in the USA and the inspiration she found from Ngugi wa Thiong’s book called
            Decolonizing the Mind. Harrison explains how she was greatly influenced by people like Bridget O’Laughlin
            who gave up the academia and a prestigious appointment to rather study in Africa with people who were facing
            a real struggle in their lives. Harrison states that the reason Anthropologists are in a position to
            influence the decolonization of anthropology is because of the participatory ethic held by Anthropologists.
            They immerse themselves into everyday lives of everyday people in order to be encultured again. It is this
            participatory ethic that makes anthropologists return to the field sites again and again over extended
            periods of time to complete their ethnographic work. She also states that Anthropologists do much more than
            just participant observation, unstructured and informal interviews to ensure a robust ethnographic study.

          <br>
          <p><span class="bold-text">About the article: </span>In this article, Thornton proposes a new approach to
            South African archaeology and history by considering the role of African indigenous cultural, ritual and
            symbolic thought processes. It calls for a need to reinterpret the archaeological landscape and material
            culture using southern African traditional knowledge systems. He states that so much knowledge is preserved
            in the knowledge of the sangoma which he believes should be combined with the fields of archaeology,
            anthropology and history in order to produce new perspectives. Thornton believes that the bungoma system is
            the answer (indigenous knowledge systems) to a more structured understandable theoretical approach to
            research. Thornton proposes a new exploratory approach that goes beyond the contemporary knowledge of
            academic anthropology and bungoma. He feels that many accepted theories regarding the history of southern
            Africa have yet to be adequately explained and that the relatively narrow focus of study currently should be
            broadened to accommodate a multidisciplinary approach to research. Thornton wants to follow the religious
            and ritual beliefs of bungoma, instead of the economic-evolutionist paradigms that are commonly used in
            order to investigate the archaeological landscape of southern Africa in a different light with different
            alternative explanations. </p>

          <h4>Final reflection on the module APY4801 Introduction to Anthropological Research.</h4>
          <p>I found this module quite challenging in that there were some aspects that were accepted as common knowledge but which I have never before encountered. One example is the themed analysis of an interview. I had to do quite a bit of reading to find out that themed analysis is actually a real thing and manner of analyzing information. I am still quite unsure of exactly what statistical methods can be used in the processing of Anthropological data. Natrass’s article that we had to defend spoke of types of data analysis that are still foreign to me, I will definitely not know how to implement or interpret further studies. I felt quite stupid as everyone else seems to know what is going on, but I was unaware of many themes and what seems to be accepted practice. At this stage of honors, I can only blame myself for not reading up more, particularly books on statistical analysis of qualitative data.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I am still not sure if this is the proposal we are supposed to complete at the end of the course? Or can we completely pick another topic altogether to present in HHAAR81</p>
          <br>
          <p>I became very aware of the fact that the face of Anthropology is changing and the manner in which we approach it is changing to a more digital approach and along with that comes many ethical issues and responsibilities.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I found that African Anthropology has a very negative influence on the field as a whole – the criticism outweighs the contribution that should be made by people in the know. I find it hard to believe that there is no outcome after post colonialism to guide Anthropologists new to the field.</p>
          <br>
          <p> I found the guidance from the tutors to be quite confusing and not always transparent e.g. the instructions for the assignments were not always clear and obvious. I am not a fan of the ungrading marking process either, how can I receive a mark of 59% for my own proposal but then 97% for the marking of others? How can I be adequately critical if I am not truly able to write a high quality proposal myself? I hated the fact that deadlines were never met, I am a stickler for dates, why do I rush and stress to meet the deadlines only to find that they are extended and postponed to later dates? That is unfair to students who take the process seriously.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I found some of the reference material outdated and irrelevant and not adequately supported by the study notes supplied by UNISA. As with most of the honors modules that I have completed, I found it frustrating that the study material is only based on African studies and would really love to see more international material and to study more about international matters.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I found the on line participation suitable and assignments were easy to submit. In general, I found that the course forced me to open my mind to new ways of analyzing and dealing with problems, as well as the fact that much more of the research will have to be self-study from now on. If one does manage to locate all the recommended literature then I feel that semester courses might be too short to cover all the material.</p>
